vlcj
====

The vlcj project provides a Java framework to allow an instance of a native
[vlc](http://www.videolan.org/vlc "vlc") media player to be embedded in a Java 
AWT Window or Swing JFrame. 

You get more than just simple bindings, you also get a higher level framework
that hides a lot of the complexities of working with libvlc.

vlcj works just fine on Linux and Windows and should work on Mac - but for Mac
you likely need a bleeding-edge release of vlc.

At least JDK 1.6 is required, and it works without changes on JDK 1.7.

This is the open source vlcj project page, see also the 'official' 
[home page](http://www.capricasoftware.co.uk/vlcj "Official vlcj home page at Caprica Software")
where you can find more information as well as some new simple tutorials.
